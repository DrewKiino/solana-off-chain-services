# Solana Off-Chain Services

Test bed for creating and experimenting with different Solana web3 ideas.

## How to Run

1. Run the server `docker-compose up`

    This runs `MySQL` for the Express server to communicate with.

2. Run the web3 scripts `yarn start`

    Currently runs a different service depending on the currently tested API uncommented in the code.

## Ideas

1. Top 10 Token Account Watcher & Aggregator
2. NFT Sniper
3. Account Transaction Observer (total scrape both Future & Past)
